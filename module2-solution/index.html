			<h2 class="blue-background"> Plitvice Lakes </h2>
			<p>This national park is more like a scene from a fairy tale than an actual place on earth, but the 16 crystal clear lakes, breathtaking waterfalls and vaulted caves are not only real—they’re natural formations. Water rich with minerals winds its way down waterfalls and along rocks, continuously changing the landscape as diverse wildlife live in the vast forest that surrounds the lakes. </p>
